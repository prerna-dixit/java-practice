# Chapter 3: Conditional Statements – Java DSA Practice 🧠💻

This folder contains beginner-level Java programs that demonstrate the use of **conditional statements** such as `if`, `else`, `else if`, `switch`, and the **ternary operator**. These are essential for writing logic-based decision-making code.
